#
# We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i]
# is the profit of the ith job. 
#
# Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which
# means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most
# worker[i]. 
#
# Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed
# multiple times.
#
# For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total
# profit will be $3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.
#
# What is the most profit we can make?
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker =
# [4,5,6,7]
# Output: 100
# Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get
# profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.
#
# Notes:
#
#
# 1 <= difficulty.length = profit.length <= 10000
# 1 <= worker.length <= 10000
# difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i]  are in range [1, 10^5]
