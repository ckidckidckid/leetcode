# Testcase Example:  '"aab"'
#
# Given a string S, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two
# characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.
#
# If possible, output any possible result.Â  If not possible, return the empty
# string.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: S = "aab"
# Output: "aba"
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: S = "aaab"
# Output: ""
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# S will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range [1, 500].
