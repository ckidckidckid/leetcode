# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]'
#
# On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5,
# and an empty square represented by 0.
#
# A move consists of choosing 0Â and a 4-directionally adjacent number and
# swapping it.
#
# The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is
# [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].
#
# Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the
# state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board
# to be solved, return -1.
#
# Examples:
#
#
# Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
#
#
#
# Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
#
#
#
# Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
# An example path:
# After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
# After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
# After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
# After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
# After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
# After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
#
#
#
# Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
# Output: 14
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# board will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
# board[i][j] will be a permutation of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
