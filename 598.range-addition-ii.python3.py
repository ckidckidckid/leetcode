# Testcase Example:  '3\n3\n[[2,2],[3,3]]'
#
# Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update
# operations.
# Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented
# by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be
# added by one for all 0  and 0 .
# You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix
# after performing all the operations.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# m = 3, n = 3
# operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# Initially, M =
# [[0, 0, 0],
# ⁠[0, 0, 0],
# ⁠[0, 0, 0]]
#
# After performing [2,2], M =
# [[1, 1, 0],
# ⁠[1, 1, 0],
# ⁠[0, 0, 0]]
#
# After performing [3,3], M =
# [[2, 2, 1],
# ⁠[2, 2, 1],
# ⁠[1, 1, 1]]
#
# So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return
# 4.
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# The range of m and n is [1,40000].
# The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
# The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.
