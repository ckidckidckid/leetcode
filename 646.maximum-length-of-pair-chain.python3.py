# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]'
#
#
# You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always
# smaller than the second number.
#
#
#
# Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b
# < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.
#
#
#
# Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You
# needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].
