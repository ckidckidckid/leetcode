#
# Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.
#
# A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for
# the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum
# of the preceding two.
#
# Given a string containing only digits '0'-'9', write a function to determine
# if it's an additive number.
#
# Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence
# 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: "112358"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
# 8.
# 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: "199100199"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.Â 
# 1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
#
# Follow up:
# How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?
