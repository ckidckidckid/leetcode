#
# This question is the same as "Max Chunks to Make Sorted" except the integers
# of the given array are not necessarily distinct, the input array could be up
# to length 2000, and the elements could be up to 10**8.
#
#
#
# Given an array arr of integers (not necessarily distinct), we split the array
# into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.
# After concatenating them,Â the result equals the sorted array.
#
# What is the most number of chunks we could have made?
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
# For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3],
# which isn't sorted.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
# However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks
# possible.
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# arr will have length in range [1, 2000].
# arr[i] will be an integer in range [0, 10**8].
