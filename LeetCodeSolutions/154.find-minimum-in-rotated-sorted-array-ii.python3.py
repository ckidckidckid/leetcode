# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5]'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
#
# (i.e., Â [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]Â might become Â [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
#
# Find the minimum element.
#
# The array may contain duplicates.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [1,3,5]
# Output: 1
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
# Output: 0
#
# Note:
#
#
# This is a follow up problem toÂ Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
# Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
