#
# We are given an array A of positive integers, and two positive integers L and
# R (L <= R).
#
# Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of
# the maximum array element in that subarray is at least L and at most R.
#
#
# Example :
# Input:
# A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
# L = 2
# R = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2,
# 1], [3].
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# L, RÂ  and A[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
# The length of A will be in the range of [1, 50000].
#
#
